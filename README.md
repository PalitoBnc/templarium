# Templarium

**Templarium** is a C++ template library for algorithms and data structures.  
It is a personal project designed for learning, experimentation, and creating reusable generic code.

Although C++ already provides the STL (Standard Template Library), Templarium aims to be a self-built, educational alternative — implementing sorting algorithms, data structures, and utilities from scratch, all with generic type support.
